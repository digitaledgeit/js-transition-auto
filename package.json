  "description": "CSS transitions don't work on elements with height: auto. They can kind of be implemented with max-height: some-fixed-height but the transition timing is never right. This function sets the width/height of an element to be the same as its computed value at auto so that your CSS width/height transition works (add the transition rule in your CSS).",
